By contrast, Eastern Roman Empire (also known Byzantine Empire) resisted attacks barbarians, continued advance various fields learning, including physics. In sixth century Isidore Miletus created important compilation Archimedes works copied Archimedes Palimpsest. In sixth century Europe John Philoponus, Byzantine scholar, questioned Aristotle teaching physics noted flaws. He introduced theory impetus. Aristotle physics scrutinized Philoponus appeared; unlike Aristotle, based physics verbal argument, Philoponus relied observation. On Aristotle physics Philoponus wrote: But completely erroneous, view may corroborated actual observation effectively sort verbal argument.

And so, difference weights considerable, is, one is, let us say, double other, difference, else imperceptible difference, time, though difference weight means negligible, one body weighing twice much Philoponus criticism Aristotelian principles physics served inspiration Galileo Galilei ten centuries later, Scientific Revolution. Galileo cited Philoponus substantially works arguing Aristotelian physics flawed. In Jean Buridan, teacher faculty arts University Paris, developed concept impetus.

The scientific method employs priori reasoning well posteriori reasoning use Bayesian inference measure validity given theory. The development physics answered many questions early philosophers, also raised new questions. Study philosophical issues surrounding physics, philosophy physics, involves issues nature space time, determinism, metaphysical outlooks empiricism, naturalism realism. Many physicists written philosophical implications work, instance Laplace, championed causal determinism, Erwin Schrödinger, wrote quantum mechanics.

Core theories Further information: Branches physics Outline physics Though physics deals wide variety systems, certain theories used physicists. Each theories experimentally tested numerous times found adequate approximation nature. For instance, theory classical mechanics accurately describes motion objects, provided much larger atoms moving much less speed light. These theories continue areas active research today. Chaos theory, remarkable aspect classical mechanics discovered th century, three centuries original formulation classical mechanics Isaac Newton ( – ). These central theories important tools research specialised topics, physicist, regardless specialisation, expected literate them. These include classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics statistical mechanics, electromagnetism, special relativity. Classical physics Main article: Classical physics Classical physics implemented acoustic engineering model sound reflecting acoustic diffuser Classical physics includes traditional branches topics recognised well developed beginning th century—classical mechanics, acoustics, optics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism. Classical mechanics concerned bodies acted forces bodies motion may divided statics (study forces body bodies subject acceleration), kinematics (study motion without regard causes), dynamics (study motion forces affect it); mechanics may also divided solid mechanics fluid mechanics (known together continuum mechanics), latter include branches hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, aerodynamics, pneumatics. Acoustics study sound produced, controlled, transmitted received.Important modern branches acoustics include ultrasonics, study sound waves high frequency beyond range human hearing; bioacoustics, physics animal calls hearing, electroacoustics, manipulation audible sound waves using electronics.Optics, study light, concerned visible light also infrared ultraviolet radiation, exhibit phenomena visible light except visibility, e.g., reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion, polarization light. Heat form energy, internal energy possessed particles substance composed; thermodynamics deals relationships heat forms energy. Electricity magnetism studied single branch physics since intimate connection discovered early th century; electric current gives rise magnetic field, changing magnetic field induces electric current. Electrostatics deals electric charges rest, electrodynamics moving charges, magnetostatics magnetic poles rest.

For example, atomic nuclear physics studies matter smallest scale chemical elements identified. The physics elementary particles even smaller scale since concerned basic units matter; branch physics also known high energy physics extremely high energies necessary produce many types particles particle accelerators. On scale, ordinary, commonsensical notions space, time, matter, energy longer valid. The two chief theories modern physics present different picture concepts space, time, matter presented classical physics. Classical mechanics approximates nature continuous, quantum theory concerned discrete nature many phenomena atomic subatomic level complementary aspects particles waves description phenomena. The theory relativity concerned description phenomena take place frame reference motion respect observer; special theory relativity concerned motion absence gravitational fields general theory relativity motion connection gravitation. Both quantum theory theory relativity find applications areas modern physics. Difference classical modern physics The basic domains physics While physics aims discover universal laws, theories lie explicit domains applicability. Loosely speaking, laws classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales greater atomic scale whose motions much slower speed light. Outside domain, observations match predictions provided classical mechanics. Albert Einstein contributed framework special relativity, replaced notions absolute time space spacetime allowed accurate description systems whose components speeds approaching speed light. Max Planck, Erwin Schrödinger, others introduced quantum mechanics, probabilistic notion particles interactions allowed accurate description atomic subatomic scales. Later, quantum field theory unified quantum mechanics special relativity. General relativity allowed dynamical, curved spacetime, highly massive systems large scale structure universe well described. General relativity yet unified fundamental descriptions; several candidate theories quantum gravity developed. Relation fields This parabola shaped lava flow illustrates application mathematics physics—in case, Galileo law falling bodies. Mathematics ontology used physics. Physics used chemistry cosmology. Prerequisites Mathematics provides compact exact language used describe order nature. This noted advocated Pythagoras, Plato, Galileo, Newton. Physics uses mathematics organise formulate experimental results. From results, precise estimated solutions obtained, quantitative results new predictions made experimentally confirmed negated. The results physics experiments numerical data, units measure estimates errors measurements. Technologies based mathematics, like computation made computational physics active area research. The distinction mathematics physics clear cut, always obvious, especially mathematical physics. Ontology prerequisite physics, mathematics. It means physics ultimately concerned descriptions real world, mathematics concerned abstract patterns, even beyond real world. Thus physics statements synthetic, mathematical statements analytic. Mathematics contains hypotheses, physics contains theories. Mathematics statements logically true, predictions physics statements must match observed experimental data. The distinction clear cut, always obvious. For example, mathematical physics application mathematics physics. Its methods mathematical, subject physical. The problems field start mathematical model physical situation (system) mathematical description physical law applied system. Every mathematical statement used solving hard find physical meaning. The final mathematical solution easier find meaning, solver looking for. clarification needed Pure physics branch fundamental science (also called basic science) . Physics also called fundamental science branches natural science like chemistry, astronomy, geology, biology constrained laws physics. Similarly, chemistry often called central science role linking physical sciences. For example, chemistry studies properties, structures, reactions matter (chemistry focus molecular atomic scale distinguishes physics). Structures formed particles exert electrical forces other, properties include physical characteristics given substances, reactions bound laws physics, like conservation energy, mass, charge. Physics applied industries like engineering medicine. Application influence Main article: Applied physics Archimedes screw, simple machine lifting The application physical laws lifting liquids Applied physics general term physics research intended particular use. An applied physics curriculum usually contains classes applied discipline, like geology electrical engineering. It usually differs engineering applied physicist may designing something particular, rather using physics conducting physics research aim developing new technologies solving problem. The approach similar applied mathematics. Applied physicists use physics scientific research. For instance, people working accelerator physics might seek build better particle detectors research theoretical physics. Physics used heavily engineering. For example, statics, subfield mechanics, used building bridges static structures. The understanding use acoustics results sound control better concert halls; similarly, use optics creates better optical devices. An understanding physics makes realistic flight simulators, video games, movies, often critical forensic investigations. With standard consensus laws physics universal change time, physics used study things would ordinarily mired uncertainty. For example, study origin earth, one reasonably model earth mass, temperature, rate rotation, function time allowing one extrapolate forward backward time predict future prior events. It also allows simulations engineering drastically speed development new technology. But also considerable interdisciplinarity, many important fields influenced physics (e.g., fields econophysics sociophysics). Research Scientific method Physicists use scientific method test validity physical theory. By using methodical approach compare implications theory conclusions drawn related experiments observations, physicists better able test validity theory logical, unbiased, repeatable way. To end, experiments performed observations made order determine validity invalidity theory. A scientific law concise verbal mathematical statement relation expresses fundamental principle theory, Newton law universal gravitation. Theory experiment Main articles: Theoretical physics Experimental physics The astronaut Earth free fall Lightning electric current Theorists seek develop mathematical models agree existing experiments successfully predict future experimental results, experimentalists devise perform experiments test theoretical predictions explore new phenomena. Although theory experiment developed separately, strongly affect depend upon other. Progress physics frequently comes experimental results def explanation existing theories, prompting intense focus applicable modelling, new theories generate experimentally testable predictions, inspire developing new experiments (and often related equipment, possibly roping applied physicists help build it). Physicists work interplay theory experiment called phenomenologists, study complex phenomena observed experiment work relate fundamental theory. Theoretical physics historically taken inspiration philosophy; electromagnetism unified way. Beyond known universe, field theoretical physics also deals hypothetical issues, e parallel universes, multiverse, higher dimensions. Theorists invoke ideas hopes solving particular problems existing theories. They explore consequences ideas work toward making testable predictions. Experimental physics expands, expanded by, engineering technology. Experimental physicists involved basic research design perform experiments equipment particle accelerators lasers, whereas involved applied research often work industry developing technologies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) transistors. Feynman noted experimentalists may seek areas explored well theorists. Physics SCIENCE WRITTEN BY: Richard Tilghman Weidner Laurie M.

Both experiment, observation phenomena conditions controlled precisely possible, theory, formulation unified conceptual framework, play essential complementary roles advancement physics. Physical experiments result measurements, compared outcome predicted theory. A theory reliably predicts results experiments applicable said embody law physics. However, law always subject modification, replacement, restriction limited domain, later experiment makes necessary. The ultimate aim physics find unified set laws governing matter, motion, energy small (microscopic) subatomic distances, human (macroscopic) scale everyday life, largest distances (e.g., extragalactic scale). This ambitious goal realized notable extent. Although completely unified theory physical phenomena yet achieved (and possibly never be), remarkably small set fundamental physical laws appears able account known phenomena.

During latter half th century, coherent picture evolved underlying strata matter involving two types subatomic particles: fermions (baryons leptons), odd half-integral angular momentum (spin / , / ) make ordinary matter; bosons (gluons, mesons, photons), integral spins mediate fundamental forces physics. Leptons (e.g., electrons, muons, taus), gluons, photons believed truly fundamental particles. Baryons (e.g., neutrons, protons) mesons (e.g., pions, kaons), collectively known hadrons, believed formed indivisible elements known quarks, never isolated. Quarks come six types, flavours, matching antiparticles, known antiquarks. Quarks charges either positive two-thirds negative one-third electrons charge, antiquarks opposite charges. Like quarks, lepton antiparticle properties mirror partner (the antiparticle negatively charged electron positive electron, positron; neutrino antineutrino). In addition electric magnetic properties, quarks participate strong force (which binds together) weak force (which underlies certain forms radioactivity), leptons take part weak force.

(This unusual use term colour somewhat forced analogue ordinary colour mixing.) Quarks said come three colours—red, blue, green. (The opposites imaginary colours, minus-red, minus-blue, minus-green, ascribed antiquarks.) Only certain colour combinations, namely colour-neutral, white (i.e., equal mixtures colours cancel one another, resulting net colour), conjectured exist nature observable form. The gluons quarks themselves, coloured, permanently confined (deeply bound within particles part), colour-neutral composites protons directly observed. One consequence colour confinement observable particles either electrically neutral charges integral multiples charge electron. A number specific predictions QCD experimentally tested found correct. SpaceNext Quantum mechanics Although various branches physics differ experimental methods theoretical approaches, certain general principles apply them. The forefront contemporary advances physics lies submicroscopic regime, whether atomic, nuclear, condensed-matter, plasma, particle physics, quantum optics, even study stellar structure. All based upon quantum theory (i.e., quantum mechanics quantum field theory) relativity, together form theoretical foundations modern physics. Many physical quantities whose classical counterparts vary continuously range possible values quantum theory constrained discontinuous, discrete, values. Furthermore, intrinsically deterministic character values classical physics replaced quantum theory intrinsic uncertainty. Elementary Particles series.

Quantum wave, quantum mechanics BRITANNICA QUIZ Quantum Mechanics Max Plancks great discovery radiation energy emitted packets called what? According quantum theory, electromagnetic radiation always consist continuous waves; instead must viewed circumstances collection particle-like photons, energy momentum directly proportional frequency (or inversely proportional wavelength, photons still possessing wavelike characteristics). Conversely, electrons objects appear particles classical physics endowed quantum theory wavelike properties well, particles quantum wavelength inversely proportional momentum. In instances, proportionality constant characteristic quantum action (action defined energy × time)—that say, Plancks constant divided π, ℏ. In principle, atomic molecular physics, including structure atoms dynamics, periodic table elements chemical behaviour, well spectroscopic, electrical, physical properties atoms, molecules, condensed matter, accounted quantum mechanics. Roughly speaking, electrons atom must fit around nucleus sort standing wave (as given Schrödinger equation) analogous waves plucked violin guitar string. As fit determines wavelength quantum wave, necessarily determines energy state. Consequently, atomic systems restricted certain discrete, quantized, energies. When atom undergoes discontinuous transition, quantum jump, energy changes abruptly sharply defined amount, photon energy emitted energy atom decreases, absorbed opposite case. The Bohr theory sees electron (left) point mass occupying certain energy levels. Wave mechanics sees electron wave washing back forth atom certain patterns only. The wave patterns energy levels correspond exactly. The Bohr theory sees electron (left) point mass occupying certain energy levels. Wave mechanics sees electron wave washing back forth atom certain patterns only. The wave patterns energy levels correspond exactly. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Although atomic energies sharply defined, positions electrons within atom cannot be, quantum mechanics giving probability electrons certain locations. This consequence feature distinguishes quantum theory approaches physics, uncertainty principle German physicist Werner Heisenberg. This principle holds measuring particles position increasing precision necessarily increases uncertainty particles momentum, conversely. The ultimate degree uncertainty controlled magnitude Plancks constant, small apparent effects except world microstructures. In latter case, however, particles position velocity momentum must known precisely instant order predict future history, quantum theory precludes certain prediction thus escapes determinism. The complementary wave particle aspects, wave–particle duality, electromagnetic radiation material particles furnish another illustration uncertainty principle. When electron exhibits wavelike behaviour, phenomenon electron diffraction, excludes exhibiting particle-like behaviour observation. Similarly, electromagnetic radiation form photons interacts matter, Compton effect X-ray photons collide electrons, result resembles particle-like collision wave nature electromagnetic radiation precluded. The principle complementarity, asserted Danish physicist Niels Bohr, pioneered theory atomic structure, states physical world presents form various complementary pictures, one complete, pictures essential total understanding. Thus wave particle pictures needed understanding either electron photon. The Compton effectWhen beam X-rays aimed target material, beam deflected, scattered X-rays greater wavelength original beam. The physicist Arthur Holly Compton concluded phenomenon could explained X-rays understood made discrete bundles particles, called photons, lost energy collisions electrons target material scattered lower energy. The Compton effectWhen beam X-rays aimed target material, beam deflected, scattered X-rays greater wavelength original beam. The physicist Arthur Holly Compton concluded phenomenon could explained X-rays understood made discrete bundles particles, called photons, lost energy collisions electrons target material scattered lower energy. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Although deals probabilities uncertainties, quantum theory spectacularly successful explaining otherwise inaccessible atomic phenomena thus far meeting every experimental test. Its predictions, especially QED, precise best checked physics; tested found accurate better one part per billion. Relativistic mechanics In classical physics, space conceived absolute character empty stage events nature unfold time flows onward independently; events occurring simultaneously one observer presumed simultaneous other; mass taken impossible create destroy; particle given sufficient energy acquires velocity increase without limit. The special theory relativity, developed principally Albert Einstein adequately confirmed experiment status physical law, shows these, well apparently obvious assumptions, false. Specific unusual relativistic effects flow directly Einsteins two basic postulates, formulated terms so-called inertial reference frames. These reference systems move way Isaac Newtons first law, law inertia, valid. The set inertial frames consists move constant velocity respect (accelerating frames therefore excluded). Einsteins postulates are: ( ) All observers, whatever state motion relative light source, measure speed light; ( ) The laws physics inertial frames. The first postulate, constancy speed light, experimental fact follow distinctive relativistic phenomena space contraction (or Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction), time dilation, relativity simultaneity: measured observer assumed rest, object motion contracted along direction motion, moving clocks run slow; two spatially separated events simultaneous stationary observer occur sequentially moving observer. As consequence, space intervals three-dimensional space related time intervals, thus forming so-called four-dimensional space-time. Length contraction time dilationAs object approaches speed light, observer sees object become shorter time interval become longer, relative length time interval object rest. Length contraction time dilationAs object approaches speed light, observer sees object become shorter time interval become longer, relative length time interval object rest. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. The second postulate called principle relativity. It equally valid classical mechanics (but classical electrodynamics Einstein reinterpreted it). This postulate implies, example, table tennis played train moving constant velocity like table tennis played train rest, states rest motion physically indistinguishable. In relativity theory, mechanical quantities momentum energy forms different classical counterparts give values speeds small compared speed light, maximum permissible speed nature (about , kilometres per second, , miles per second). According relativity, mass energy equivalent interchangeable quantities, equivalence expressed Einsteins famous mass-energy equation E = mc , objects mass c speed light. The general theory relativity Einsteins theory gravitation, uses principle equivalence gravitation locally accelerating frames reference. Einsteins theory special mathematical beauty; generalizes flat space-time concept special relativity one curvature. It forms background modern cosmological theories. In contrast vulgarized popular notions it, confuse moral forms relativism, Einsteins theory argue relative. On contrary, largely theory based upon physical attributes change, or, language theory, invariant. Conservation laws symmetry Since early period modern physics, conservation laws, state certain physical quantities, total electric charge isolated system bodies, change course time. In th century proved mathematically laws follow symmetry properties nature, expressed laws physics. The conservation mass-energy isolated system, example, follows assumption laws physics may depend upon time intervals upon specific time laws applied. The symmetries conservation laws follow regarded modern physicists even fundamental laws themselves, since able limit possible forms laws may proposed future. Conservation laws valid classical, relativistic, quantum theory mass-energy, momentum, angular momentum, electric charge. (In nonrelativistic physics, mass energy separately conserved.) Momentum, directed quantity equal mass body multiplied velocity total mass two bodies multiplied velocity centre mass, conserved when, when, external force acts. Similarly angular momentum, related spinning motions, conserved system upon net turning force, called torque, acts. External forces torques break symmetry conditions respective conservation laws follow. In quantum theory, especially theory elementary particles, additional symmetries conservation laws, exact others approximately valid, play significant role classical physics. Among conservation so-called quantum numbers related left-right reflection symmetry space (called parity) reversal symmetry motion (called time reversal). These quantum numbers conserved processes weak force. Other symmetry properties obviously related space time (and referred internal symmetries) characterize different families elementary particles and, extension, composites. Quarks, example, property called baryon number, protons, neutrons, nuclei, unstable quark composites. All except quarks known baryons. A failure baryon-number conservation would exhibit itself, instance, proton decaying lighter non-baryonic particles. Indeed, intensive search proton decay conducted, far fruitless. Similar symmetries conservation laws hold analogously defined lepton number, also appear, law baryon conservation, hold absolutely. Fundamental forces fields The four basic forces nature, order increasing strength, thought be: ( ) gravitational force particles mass; ( ) electromagnetic force particles charge magnetism both; ( ) colour force, strong force, quarks; ( ) weak force which, example, quarks change type, neutron decays proton, electron, antineutrino. The strong force binds protons neutrons nuclei responsible fission, fusion, nuclear reactions principle derived colour force. Nuclear physics thus related QCD chemistry atomic physics. Sequence events fission uranium nucleus neutron. Sequence events fission uranium nucleus neutron. Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. According quantum field theory, four fundamental interactions mediated exchange quanta, called vector gauge bosons, share certain common characteristics. All intrinsic spin one unit, measured terms Plancks constant ℏ. (Leptons quarks one-half unit spin.) Gauge theory studies group transformations, Lie group, leaves basic physics quantum field invariant. Lie groups, named th-century Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, possess special type symmetry continuity made first useful study differential equations smooth manifolds (an abstract mathematical space modeling physical processes). This symmetry first seen equations electromagnetic potentials, quantities electromagnetic fields derived. It possessed pure form eight massless gluons QCD, electroweak theory—the unified theory electromagnetic weak force interactions—gauge symmetry partially broken, photon remains massless, gauge bosons (W+, W−, Z) acquiring large masses. Theoretical physicists continue seek unification QCD electroweak theory and, ambitiously still, unify quantum version gravity force would transmitted massless quanta two units spin called gravitons. SpaceNext The Methodology Of Physics Physics evolved continues evolve without single strategy. Essentially experimental science, refined measurements reveal unexpected behaviour. On hand, mathematical extrapolation existing theories new theoretical areas, critical reexamination apparently obvious untested assumptions, argument symmetry analogy, aesthetic judgment, pure accident, hunch—each plays role (as science). Thus, example, quantum hypothesis proposed German physicist Max Planck based observed departures character blackbody radiation (radiation emitted heated body absorbs radiant energy incident upon it) predicted classical electromagnetism. The English physicist P.A.M. Dirac predicted existence positron making relativistic extension quantum theory electron. The elusive neutrino, without mass charge, hypothesized German physicist Wolfgang Pauli alternative abandoning conservation laws beta-decay process. Maxwell conjectured changing magnetic fields create electric fields (which known so), changing electric fields might create magnetic fields, leading electromagnetic theory light. Albert Einsteins special theory relativity based critical reexamination meaning simultaneity, general theory relativity rests equivalence inertial gravitational mass. Although tactics may vary problem problem, physicist invariably tries make unsolved problems tractable constructing series idealized models, successive model realistic representation actual physical situation. Thus, theory gases, molecules first imagined particles structureless billiard balls vanishingly small dimensions. This ideal picture improved step step. The correspondence principle, useful guiding principle extending theoretical interpretations, formulated Danish physicist Niels Bohr context quantum theory. It asserts valid theory generalized broader arena, new theorys predictions must agree old one overlapping region applicable. For example, comprehensive theory physical optics must yield result restrictive theory ray optics whenever wave effects proportional wavelength light negligible account smallness wavelength. Similarly, quantum mechanics must yield results classical mechanics circumstances Plancks constant considered negligibly small. Likewise, speeds small compared speed light (as baseballs play), relativistic mechanics must coincide Newtonian classical mechanics. Some ways experimental theoretical physicists attack problems illustrated following examples. The modern experimental study elementary particles began detection new types unstable particles produced atmosphere primary radiation, latter consisting mainly high-energy protons arriving space. The new particles detected Geiger counters identified tracks left instruments called cloud chambers photographic plates. After World War II, particle physics, known high-energy nuclear physics, became major field science. Todays high-energy particle accelerators several kilometres length, cost hundreds (or even thousands) millions dollars, accelerate particles enormous energies (trillions electron volts). Experimental teams, discovered W+, W−, Z quanta weak force European Laboratory Particle Physics (CERN) Geneva, funded European member states, physicists many countries, along larger number technical workers serving support personnel. A variety visual electronic techniques used interpret sort huge amounts data produced efforts, particle-physics laboratories major users advanced technology, superconductive magnets supercomputers. Theoretical physicists use mathematics logical tool development theory calculating predictions theory compared experiment. Newton, one, invented integral calculus solve following problem, essential formulation law universal gravitation: Assuming attractive force pair point particles inversely proportional square distance separating them, spherical distribution particles, Earth, attract another nearby object? Integral calculus, procedure summing many small contributions, yields simple solution Earth acts point particle mass concentrated centre. In modern physics, Dirac predicted existence then-unknown positive electron (or positron) finding equation electron would combine quantum mechanics special theory relativity. Relations Between Physics And Other Disciplines And Society Influence physics related disciplines Because physics elucidates simplest fundamental questions nature consensus, hardly surprising profound impact fields science, philosophy, worldview developed world, and, course, technology. Indeed, whenever branch physics reached degree maturity basic elements comprehended general principles, moved basic applied physics thence technology. Thus almost current activity classical physics consists applied physics, contents form core many branches engineering. Discoveries modern physics converted increasing rapidity technical innovations analytical tools associated disciplines. There are, example, nascent fields nuclear biomedical engineering, quantum chemistry quantum optics, radio, X-ray, gamma-ray astronomy, well analytic tools radioisotopes, spectroscopy, lasers, stem directly basic physics. Apart specific applications, physics—especially Newtonian mechanics—has become prototype scientific method, experimental analytic methods sometimes imitated (and sometimes inappropriately so) fields far related physical sciences. Some organizational aspects physics, based partly successes radar atomic-bomb projects World War II, also imitated large-scale scientific projects, as, example, astronomy space research. The great influence physics branches philosophy concerned conceptual basis human perceptions understanding nature, epistemology, evidenced earlier designation physics natural philosophy. Present-day philosophy science deals largely, though exclusively, foundations physics. Determinism, philosophical doctrine universe vast machine operating strict causality whose future determined detail present state, rooted Newtonian mechanics, obeys principle. Moreover, schools materialism, naturalism, empiricism large degree considered physics model philosophical inquiry. An extreme position taken logical positivists, whose radical distrust reality anything directly observable leads demand significant statements must formulated language physics. The uncertainty principle quantum theory prompted reexamination question determinism, philosophical implications remain doubt. Particularly problematic matter meaning measurement, recent theories experiments confirm apparently noncausal predictions standard quantum theory. It fair say though physicists agree quantum theory works, still differ means.Kinematics branch classical mechanics describes motion points, bodies (objects), systems bodies (groups objects) without considering forces cause move.[ ][ ][ ] Kinematics, field study, often referred geometry motion occasionally seen branch mathematics.[ ][ ][ ] A kinematics problem begins describing geometry system declaring initial conditions known values position, velocity and/or acceleration points within system. Then, using arguments geometry, position, velocity acceleration unknown parts system determined. The study forces act bodies falls within kinetics, kinematics. For details, see analytical dynamics. Kinematics used astrophysics describe motion celestial bodies collections bodies. In mechanical engineering, robotics, biomechanics[ ] kinematics used describe motion systems composed joined parts (multi-link systems) engine, robotic arm human skeleton. Geometric transformations, also called rigid transformations, used describe movement components mechanical system, simplifying derivation equations motion. They also central dynamic analysis. Kinematic analysis process measuring kinematic quantities used describe motion. In engineering, instance, kinematic analysis may used find range movement given mechanism working reverse, using kinematic synthesis design mechanism desired range motion.[ ] In addition, kinematics applies algebraic geometry study mechanical advantage mechanical system mechanism.A typical physics course concerns variety broad topics. One topic mechanics - study motion objects. The first six units The Physics Classroom tutorial involve investigation physics motion. As focus language, principles, laws describe explain motion objects, efforts center internalizing meaning information. Avoid memorizing information; avoid abstracting information physical world describes explains. Rather, contemplate information, thinking meaning applications. Kinematics science describing motion objects using words, diagrams, numbers, graphs, equations. Kinematics branch mechanics. The goal study kinematics develop sophisticated mental models serve describe (and ultimately, explain) motion real-world objects. In lesson, investigate words used describe motion objects.

The motion moving object explained using either Newtons Laws (Unit 2 The Physics Classroom) vector principles (Unit 3 The Physics Classroom) means Work-Energy Theorem (Unit 5 The Physics Classroom). The concepts principles used describe explain motion object used describe explain parabolic motion projectile. In unit, see concepts principles also used describe explain motion objects either move circles approximated moving circles. Kinematic concepts motion principles applied motion objects circles extended analyze motion objects roller coaster cars, football player making circular turn, planet orbiting sun. We see beauty power physics lies fact simple concepts principles used explain mechanics entire universe. Lesson 1 study begin development kinematic dynamic ideas used describe explain motion objects circles. Suppose driving car steering wheel turned manner car followed path perfect circle constant radius. And suppose drove, speedometer maintained constant reading 10 mi/hr. In situation this, motion car could described experiencing uniform circular motion. Uniform circular motion motion object circle constant uniform speed. Calculation Average Speed Uniform circular motion - circular motion constant speed - one many forms circular motion. An object moving uniform circular motion would cover linear distance second time. When moving circle, object traverses distance around perimeter circle. So car move circle constant speed 5 m/s, car would travel 5 meters along perimeter circle second time. The distance one complete cycle around perimeter circle known circumference. With uniform speed 5 m/s, car could make complete cycle around circle circumference 5 meters. At uniform speed 5 m/s, cycle around 5-m circumference circle would require 1 second. At 5 m/s, circle circumference 20 meters could made 4 seconds; uniform speed, every cycle around 20-m circumference circle would take time period 4 seconds. This relationship circumference circle, time complete one cycle around circle, speed object merely extension average speed equation stated Unit 1 The Physics Classroom. The circumference circle computed using radius according equation Circumference = 2piRadius Combining two equations lead new equation relating speed object moving uniform circular motion radius circle time make one cycle around circle (period). R represents radius circle T represents period. This equation, like equations, used algebraic recipe problem solving. It also used guide thinking variables equation relate other. For instance, equation suggests objects moving around circles different radius period, object traversing circle larger radius must traveling greatest speed. In fact, average speed radius circle directly proportional. A twofold increase radius corresponds twofold increase speed; threefold increase radius corresponds three--fold increase speed; on. To illustrate, consider strand four LED lights positioned various locations along strand. The strand held one end spun rapidly circle. Each LED light traverses circle different radius. Yet since connected wire, period rotation same. Subsequently, LEDs center circle traveling faster order sweep circumference larger circle amount time. If room lights turned off, LEDs created arc could perceived longer LEDs traveling faster - LEDs greatest radius. This illustrated diagram right. The Direction Velocity Vector Objects moving uniform circular motion constant speed. But mean constant velocity? Recall Unit 1 The Physics Classroom speed velocity refer two distinctly different quantities. Speed scalar quantity velocity vector quantity. Velocity, vector, magnitude direction. The magnitude velocity vector instantaneous speed object. The direction velocity vector directed direction object moves. Since object moving circle, direction continuously changing. At one moment, object moving northward velocity vector directed northward. One quarter cycle later, object would moving eastward velocity vector directed eastward. As object rounds circle, direction velocity vector different instant before. So magnitude velocity vector may constant, direction velocity vector changing. The best word used describe direction velocity vector word tangential. The direction velocity vector instant direction tangent line drawn circle objects location. (A tangent line line touches circle one point intersect it.) The diagram right shows direction velocity vector four different points object moving clockwise direction around circle. While actual direction object (and thus, velocity vector) changing, direction always tangent circle. To summarize, object moving uniform circular motion moving around perimeter circle constant speed. While speed object constant, velocity changing. Velocity, vector, constant magnitude changing direction. The direction always directed tangent circle object turns circle, tangent line always pointing new direction. We Would Like Suggest ... Sometimes isnt enough read it. You interact it!

Believing gravitational forces responsible each, Newton able draw important conclusion dependence gravity upon distance. This comparison led conclude force gravitational attraction Earth objects inversely proportional distance separating earths center objects center. But distance variable affecting magnitude gravitational force. Consider Newtons famous equation Fnet = • Newton knew force caused apples acceleration (gravity) must dependent upon mass apple. And since force acting cause apples downward acceleration also causes earths upward acceleration (Newtons third law), force must also depend upon mass earth. So Newton, force gravity acting earth object directly proportional mass earth, directly proportional mass object, inversely proportional square distance separates centers earth object. The UNIVERSAL Gravitation Equation But Newtons law universal gravitation extends gravity beyond earth. Newtons law universal gravitation universality gravity. Newtons place Gravity Hall Fame due discovery gravity, rather due discovery gravitation universal. ALL objects attract force gravitational attraction. Gravity universal. This force gravitational attraction directly dependent upon masses objects inversely proportional square distance separates centers. Newtons conclusion magnitude gravitational forces summarized symbolically Since gravitational force directly proportional mass interacting objects, massive objects attract greater gravitational force. So mass either object increases, force gravitational attraction also increases. If mass one objects doubled, force gravity doubled. If mass one objects tripled, force gravity tripled. If mass objects doubled, force gravity quadrupled; on. Since gravitational force inversely proportional square separation distance two interacting objects, separation distance result weaker gravitational forces. So two objects separated other, force gravitational attraction also decreases. If separation distance two objects doubled (increased factor 2), force gravitational attraction decreased factor 4 (2 raised second power). If separation distance two objects tripled (increased factor 3), force gravitational attraction decreased factor 9 (3 raised second power). Thinking Proportionally About Newtons Equation The proportionalities expressed Newtons universal law gravitation represented graphically following illustration. Observe force gravity directly proportional product two masses inversely proportional square distance separation. Another means representing proportionalities express relationships form equation using constant proportionality. This equation shown below. The constant proportionality (G) equation known universal gravitation constant. The precise value G determined experimentally Henry Cavendish century Newtons death. (This experiment discussed later Lesson 3.) The value G found G = 6.673 x 10-11 N m2/kg2 The units G may seem rather odd; nonetheless sensible. When units G substituted equation multiplied m1• m2 units divided d2 units, result Newtons - unit force. Using Newtons Gravitation Equation Solve Problems Knowing value G allows us calculate force gravitational attraction two objects known mass known separation distance. As first example, consider following problem. Sample Problem #1 Determine force gravitational attraction earth (m = 5.98 x 1024 kg) 70-kg physics student student standing sea level, distance 6.38 x 106 earths center. The solution problem involves substituting known values G (6.673 x 10-11 N m2/kg2), m1 (5.98 x 1024 kg), m2 (70 kg) (6.38 x 106 m) universal gravitation equation solving Fgrav. The solution follows: Sample Problem #2 Determine force gravitational attraction earth (m = 5.98 x 1024 kg) 70-kg physics student student airplane 40000 feet earths surface. This would place student distance 6.39 x 106 earths center. The solution problem involves substituting known values G (6.673 x 10-11 N m2/kg2), m1 (5.98 x 1024 kg), m2 (70 kg) (6.39 x 106 m) universal gravitation equation solving Fgrav. The solution follows: Two general conceptual comments made results two sample calculations above. First, observe force gravity acting upon student (a.k.a. students weight) less airplane 40 000 feet sea level. This illustrates inverse relationship separation distance force gravity (or case, weight student). The student weighs less higher altitude. However, mere change 40 000 feet center Earth virtually negligible. This altitude change altered students weight changed 2 N much less 1% original weight. A distance 40 000 feet (from earths surface high altitude airplane) far compared distance 6.38 x 106 (equivalent nearly 20 000 000 feet center earth surface earth). This alteration distance like drop bucket compared large radius Earth. As shown diagram below, distance separation becomes much influential significant variation made. The second conceptual comment made sample calculations use Newtons universal gravitation equation calculate force gravity (or weight) yields result calculating using equation presented Unit 2: Fgrav = m•g = (70 kg)•(9.8 m/s2) = 686 N Both equations accomplish result (as study later Lesson 3) value g equivalent ratio (G•Mearth)/(Rearth)2. The Universality Gravity Gravitational interactions simply exist earth objects; simply sun planets. Gravitational interactions exist objects intensity directly proportional product masses. So sit seat physics classroom, gravitationally attracted lab partner, desk working at, even physics book. Newtons revolutionary idea gravity universal - ALL objects attract proportion product masses. Gravity universal. Of course, gravitational forces minimal noticed. Gravitational forces recognizable masses objects become large. To illustrate this, use Newtons universal gravitation equation calculate force gravity following familiar objects.Today, Newtons law universal gravitation widely accepted theory. It guides efforts scientists study planetary orbits. Knowing objects exert gravitational influences other, small perturbations planets elliptical motion easily explained. As planet Jupiter approaches planet Saturn orbit, tends deviate otherwise smooth path; deviation, perturbation, easily explained considering effect gravitational pull Saturn Jupiter. Newtons comparison acceleration apple moon led surprisingly simple conclusion nature gravity woven entire universe. All objects attract force directly proportional product masses inversely proportional distance separation.In previous section Lesson 1, concept electric potential introduced. Electric potential location-dependent quantity expresses amount potential energy per unit charge specified location. When Coulomb charge (or given amount charge) possesses relatively large quantity potential energy given location, location said location high electric potential. And similarly, Coulomb charge (or given amount charge) possesses relatively small quantity potential energy given location, location said location low electric potential. As begin apply concepts potential energy electric potential circuits, begin refer difference electric potential two points. This part Lesson 1 devoted understanding electric potential difference application movement charge electric circuits. Consider task moving positive test charge within uniform electric field location A location B shown diagram right. In moving charge electric field location A location B, work done charge external force. The work done charge changes potential energy higher value; amount work done equal change potential energy. As result change potential energy, also difference electric potential locations A B. This difference electric potential represented symbol ΔV formally referred electric potential difference. By definition, electric potential difference difference electric potential (V) final initial location work done upon charge change potential energy. In equation form, electric potential difference The standard metric unit electric potential difference volt, abbreviated V named honor Alessandro Volta. One Volt equivalent one Joule per Coulomb. If electric potential difference two locations 1 volt, one Coulomb charge gain 1 joule potential energy moved two locations. If electric potential difference two locations 3 volts, one coulomb charge gain 3 joules potential energy moved two locations. And finally, electric potential difference two locations 12 volts, one coulomb charge gain 12 joules potential energy moved two locations. Because electric potential difference expressed units volts, sometimes referred voltage. Electric Potential Difference Simple Circuits Electric circuits, shall see, movement charge varying locations corresponding loss gain energy accompanies movement. In previous part Lesson 1, concept electric potential applied simple battery-powered electric circuit. In discussion, explained work must done positive test charge move cells negative terminal positive terminal. This work would increase potential energy charge thus increase electric potential. As positive test charge moves external circuit positive terminal negative terminal, decreases electric potential energy thus low potential time returns negative terminal. If 12 volt battery used circuit, every coulomb charge gaining 12 joules potential energy moves battery. And similarly, every coulomb charge loses 12 joules electric potential energy passes external circuit. The loss electric potential energy external circuit results gain light energy, thermal energy forms non-electrical energy. With clear understanding electric potential difference, role electrochemical cell collection cells (i.e., battery) simple circuit correctly understood. The cells simply supply energy work upon charge move negative terminal positive terminal. By providing energy charge, cell capable maintaining electric potential difference across two ends external circuit. Once charge reached high potential terminal, naturally flow wires low potential terminal. The movement charge electric circuit analogous movement water water park movement roller coaster cars amusement park. In analogy, work must done water roller coaster cars move location low gravitational potential location high gravitational potential. Once water roller coaster cars reach high gravitational potential, naturally move downward back low potential location. For water ride roller coaster ride, task lifting water coaster cars high potential requires energy. The energy supplied motor-driven water pump motor-driven chain. In battery-powered electric circuit, cells serve role charge pump supply energy charge lift low potential position cell high potential position. It often convenient speak electric circuit simple circuit discussed two parts - internal circuit external circuit. The internal circuit part circuit energy supplied charge. For simple battery-powered circuit referring to, portion circuit containing electrochemical cells internal circuit. The external circuit part circuit charge moving outside cells wires path high potential terminal low potential terminal. The movement charge internal circuit requires energy since uphill movement direction electric field. The movement charge external circuit natural since movement direction electric field. When positive terminal electrochemical cell, positive test charge high electric pressure manner water water park high water pressure pumped top water slide. Being high electric pressure, positive test charge spontaneously naturally moves external circuit low pressure, low potential location. As positive test charge moves external circuit, encounters variety types circuit elements. Each circuit element serves energy-transforming device. Light bulbs, motors, heating elements (such toasters hair dryers) examples energy-transforming devices. In devices, electrical potential energy charge transformed useful (and non-useful) forms. For instance, light bulb, electric potential energy charge transformed light energy (a useful form) thermal energy (a non-useful form). The moving charge work upon light bulb produce two different forms energy. By so, moving charge losing electric potential energy. Upon leaving circuit element, charge less energized. The location prior entering light bulb (or circuit element) high electric potential location; location leaving light bulb (or circuit element) low electric potential location. Referring diagram above, locations A B high potential locations locations C D low potential locations. The loss electric potential passing circuit element often referred voltage drop. By time positive test charge returned negative terminal, 0 volts ready re-energized pumped back high voltage, positive terminal. Electric Potential Diagrams An electric potential diagram convenient tool representing electric potential differences various locations electric circuit. Two simple circuits corresponding electric potential diagrams shown below. In Circuit A, 1.5-volt D-cell single light bulb. In Circuit B, 6-volt battery (four 1.5-volt D-cells) two light bulbs. In case, negative terminal battery 0 volt location. The positive terminal battery electric potential equal voltage rating battery. The battery energizes charge pump low voltage terminal high voltage terminal. By battery establishes electric potential difference across two ends external circuit. Being electric pressure, charge move external circuit. As electric potential energy transformed light energy heat energy light bulb locations, charge decreases electric potential. The total voltage drop across external circuit equals battery voltage charge moves positive terminal back 0 volts negative terminal. In case Circuit B, two voltage drops external circuit, one light bulb.

Ohms Law Predictor Current The Ohms law equation rearranged expressed As equation, serves algebraic recipe calculating current electric potential difference resistance known. Yet equation serves powerful recipe problem solving, much that. This equation indicates two variables would affect amount current circuit. The current circuit directly proportional electric potential difference impressed across ends inversely proportional total resistance offered external circuit. The greater battery voltage (i.e., electric potential difference), greater current. And greater resistance, less current. Charge flows greatest rates battery voltage increased resistance decreased. In fact, twofold increase battery voltage would lead twofold increase current (if factors kept equal). And increase resistance load factor two would cause current decrease factor two one-half original value. The table illustrates relationship qualitatively quantitatively several circuits varying battery voltages resistances.

var bioWords = "The cell membrane (also known as the plasma membrane (PM) or cytoplasmic membrane, and historically referred to as the plasmalemma) is a biological membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment (the extracellular space) which protects the cell from its environment.[1][2] Cell membrane is consisted of a lipid bilayer, including cholesterols (a lipid component) that sit between phospholipids to maintain their fluidity under various temperature, in combination with proteins such as integral proteins, and peripheral proteins that go across inside and outside of the membrane serving as membrane transporter, and loosely attached to the outer (peripheral) side of the cell membrane acting as several kinds of enzymes shaping the cell , respectively.[3] The cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of cells and organelles. In this way, it is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules.[4] In addition, cell membranes are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell adhesion, ion conductivity and cell signalling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures, including the cell wall, the carbohydrate layer called the glycocalyx, and the intracellular network of protein fibers called the cytoskeleton. In the field of synthetic biology, cell membranes can be artificially reassembled.[5][6][7] Cell membranes contain a variety of biological molecules, notably lipids and proteins. Composition is not set, but constantly changing for fluidity and changes in the environment, even fluctuating during different stages of cell development. Specifically, the amount of cholesterol in human primary neuron cell membrane changes, and this change in composition affects fluidity throughout development stages.[20] Material is incorporated into the membrane, or deleted from it, by a variety of mechanisms: Fusion of intracellular vesicles with the membrane (exocytosis) not only excretes the contents of the vesicle but also incorporates the vesicle membrane's components into the cell membrane. The membrane may form blebs around extracellular material that pinch off to become vesicles (endocytosis). If a membrane is continuous with a tubular structure made of membrane material, then material from the tube can be drawn into the membrane continuously. Although the concentration of membrane components in the aqueous phase is low (stable membrane components have low solubility in water), there is an exchange of molecules between the lipid and aqueous phases. The cell membrane consists of three classes of amphipathic lipids: phospholipids, glycolipids, and sterols. The amount of each depends upon the type of cell, but in the majority of cases phospholipids are the most abundant, often contributing for over 50% of all lipids in plasma membranes.[21][22] Glycolipids only account for a minute amount of about 2% and sterols make up the rest. In RBC studies, 30% of the plasma membrane is lipid. However, for the majority of eukaryotic cells, the composition of plasma membranes is about half lipids and half proteins by weight. The fatty chains in phospholipids and glycolipids usually contain an even number of carbon atoms, typically between 16 and 20. The 16- and 18-carbon fatty acids are the most common. Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated, with the configuration of the double bonds nearly always   cis  . The length and the degree of unsaturation of fatty acid chains have a profound effect on membrane fluidity as unsaturated lipids create a kink, preventing the fatty acids from packing together as tightly, thus decreasing the melting temperature (increasing the fluidity) of the membrane.[21][22] The ability of some organisms to regulate the fluidity of their cell membranes by altering lipid composition is called homeoviscous adaptation. The entire membrane is held together via non-covalent interaction of hydrophobic tails, however the structure is quite fluid and not fixed rigidly in place. Under physiological conditions phospholipid molecules in the cell membrane are in the liquid crystalline state. It means the lipid molecules are free to diffuse and exhibit rapid lateral diffusion along the layer in which they are present.[21] However, the exchange of phospholipid molecules between intracellular and extracellular leaflets of the bilayer is a very slow process. Lipid rafts and caveolae are examples of cholesterol-enriched microdomains in the cell membrane.[22] Also, a fraction of the lipid in direct contact with integral membrane proteins, which is tightly bound to the protein surface is called annular lipid shell; it behaves as a part of protein complex."

var historyWords = "The history of the United States, a country in North America, began with the settlement of Indigenous people before 15,000 BC. Numerous culturesformed. The arrival of Christopher Columbus in the year of 1492 started the European colonization of the Americas. Most colonies formed after 1600. By the 1760s, thirteen British colonies contained 2.5 million people along the Atlantic coast east of the Appalachian Mountains. After defeating France, the British government imposed a series of new taxes after 1765, rejecting the colonists  argument that new taxes needed their approval (see Stamp Act 1765). Tax resistance, especially the Boston Tea Party (1773), led to punitive laws by Parliament designed to end self-government in Massachusetts. Armed conflict began in 1775. In 1776 in Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress declared the independence of the colonies as the United States of America. Led by General George Washington, it won the Revolutionary War with large support from France. The peace treaty of 1783 gave the new nation the land east of the Mississippi River (except Canada and Florida). The Articles of Confederation established a central government, but it was ineffectual at providing stability, as it could not collect taxes and had no executive officer. A convention in 1787 wrote a new Constitution that was adopted in 1789. In 1791, a Bill of Rights was added to guarantee inalienable rights. With Washington as the first president and Alexander Hamilton his chief adviser, a strong central government was created. Purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803 doubled the size of the United States. A second and final war with Britain was fought in 1812, which solidified national pride. Encouraged by the notion of manifest destiny, U.S. territory expanded all the way to the Pacific coast. While the United States was large in terms of area, its population in 1790 was only 4 million. However, it grew rapidly, reaching 7.2 million in 1810, 32 million in 1860, 76 million in 1900, 132 million in 1940, and 321 million in 2015. Economic growth in terms of overall GDP was even greater. However compared to European powers, the nation s military strength was relatively limited in peacetime before 1940. The expansion was driven by a quest for inexpensive land for yeoman farmers and slave owners. The expansion of slavery was increasingly controversial and fueled political and constitutional battles, which were resolved by compromises. Slavery was abolished in all states north of the Mason–Dixon line by 1804, but the South continued to profit from the institution, mostly from production of cotton. Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected in 1860 on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery. Seven Southern slave states rebelled and created the foundation of the Confederacy. Its attack of Fort Sumter against the Union forces started the Civil War (1861–1865). Confederate defeat led to the impoverishment of the South and the abolition of slavery. In the Reconstruction Era (1863–1877), legal and voting rights were extended to freed slaves. The national government emerged much stronger, and because of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, it gained the explicit duty to protect individual rights. However, when white Democrats regained their power in the South in 1877, often by paramilitary suppression of voting, they passed Jim Crow laws to maintain white supremacy, and new disfranchising constitutions that prevented most African Americans and many poor whites from voting. This continued until gains of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s and passage of federal legislation to enforce constitutional rights were made. The United States became the world s leading industrial power at the turn of the 20th century due to an outburst of entrepreneurship in the Northeastand Midwest and the arrival of millions of immigrant workers and farmers from Europe. The national railroad network was completed and large-scale mining and factories industrialized the Northeast and Midwest. Mass dissatisfaction with corruption, inefficiency and traditional politics stimulated the Progressive movement, from the 1890s to 1920s, which led to many reforms including the 16th to 19th constitutional amendments, which brought the federal income tax, direct election of Senators, prohibition, and women s suffrage. Initially neutral during World War I, the United States declared war on Germany in 1917 and funded the Allied victory the following year. Women obtained the right to vote in 1920, with Native Americans obtaining citizenship and the right to vote in 1924. After a prosperous decade in the 1920s, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 marked the onset of the decade-long worldwide Great Depression. Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt ended the Republican dominance of the White House and implemented his New Deal programs, which included relief for the unemployed, support for farmers, Social Security and a minimum wage. The New Deal defined modern American liberalism. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States entered World War II and financed the Allied war effort and helped defeat Nazi Germanyin the European theater. Its involvement culminated in using newly invented nuclear weapons on two Japanese cities to defeat Imperial Japan in the Pacific theater."

var scienceWords = "Modern science is typically divided into three major branches that consist of the natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies; and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study abstract concepts. There is disagreement,[19][20] however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence.[21] Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine, are described as applied sciences.[22][23][24][25] Science is based on research, which is commonly conducted in academic and research institutions as well as in government agencies and companies. The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products, armaments, health care, and environmental protection. Formal science is involved in the study of formal systems. It includes mathematics,[96][97] systems theory, and theoretical computer science. The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge. They are, however, different from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for empirical evidence, to verify their abstract concepts.[21][98][92] The formal sciences are therefore a priori disciplines and because of this, there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science.[19][20] Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences. Calculus, for example, was initially invented to understand motion in physics.[99] Natural and social sciences that rely heavily on mathematical applications include mathematical physics, mathematical chemistry, mathematical biology, mathematical finance, and mathematical economics."

It sense Aristotle used word History Animals.[ ] The ancestor word ἵστωρ attested early Homeric Hymns, Heraclitus, Athenian ephebes' oath, Boiotic inscriptions (in legal sense, either 'judge' 'witness', similar). The Greek word borrowed Classical Latin historia, meaning "investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account past events, writing history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge past events, story, narrative". History borrowed Latin (possibly via Old Irish Old Welsh) Old English stær ('history, narrative, story'), word fell use late Old English period.[ ] Meanwhile, Latin became Old French (and Anglo-Norman), historia developed forms istorie, estoire, historie, new developments meaning: "account events person's life (beginning th century), chronicle, account events relevant group people people general ( ), dramatic pictorial representation historical events (c. ), body knowledge relative human evolution, science (c. ), narrative real imaginary events, story (c. )".[ ] It Anglo-Norman history borrowed Middle English, time loan stuck. It appears th-century Ancrene Wisse, seems become common word late th century, early attestation appearing John Gower's Confessio Amantis (VI. ): "I finde bok compiled | To matiere old histoire, | The comth nou mi memoire". In Middle English, meaning history "story" general. The restriction meaning "the branch knowledge deals past events; formal record study past events, esp. human affairs" arose mid- th century.[ ] With Renaissance, older senses word revived, Greek sense Francis Bacon used term late th century, wrote "Natural History". For him, historia "the knowledge objects determined space time", sort knowledge provided memory (while science provided reason, poetry provided fantasy).[ ] In expression linguistic synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy, English like Chinese (史 vs. 诌) designates separate words human history storytelling general. In modern German, French, Germanic Romance languages, solidly synthetic highly inflected, word still used mean 'history' 'story'. Historian sense "researcher history" attested . In European languages, substantive history still used mean "what happened men", "the scholarly study happened", latter sense sometimes distinguished capital letter, word historiography.[ ] The adjective historical attested , historic .[ ] Description The title page The Historians' History World Historians write context time, due regard current dominant ideas interpret past, sometimes write provide lessons society. In words Benedetto Croce, "All history contemporary history". History facilitated formation "true discourse past" production narrative analysis past events relating human race.[ ] The modern discipline history dedicated institutional production discourse. All events remembered preserved authentic form constitute historical record.[ ] The task historical discourse identify sources usefully contribute production accurate accounts past. Therefore, constitution historian's archive result circumscribing general archive invalidating usage certain texts documents (by falsifying claims represent "true past"). The study history sometimes classified part humanities times part social sciences.[ ] It also seen bridge two broad areas, incorporating methodologies both. Some individual historians strongly support one classification.[ ] In th century, French historian Fernand Braudel revolutionized study history, using outside disciplines economics, anthropology, geography study global history. Traditionally, historians recorded events past, either writing passing oral tradition, attempted answer historical questions study written documents oral accounts. From beginning, historians also used sources monuments, inscriptions, pictures. In general, sources historical knowledge separated three categories: written, said, physically preserved, historians often consult three.[ ] But writing marker separates history comes before. Archaeology discipline especially helpful dealing buried sites objects, which, unearthed, contribute study history. But archaeology rarely stands alone. It uses narrative sources complement discoveries. However, archaeology constituted range methodologies approaches independent history; say, archaeology "fill gaps" within textual sources. Indeed, "historical archaeology" specific branch archaeology, often contrasting conclusions contemporary textual sources. For example, Mark Leone, excavator interpreter historical Annapolis, Maryland, USA; sought understand contradiction textual documents material record, demonstrating possession slaves inequalities wealth apparent via study total historical environment, despite ideology "liberty" inherent written documents time. There varieties ways history organized, including chronologically, culturally, territorially, thematically. These divisions mutually exclusive, significant overlaps often present, "The International Women's Movement Age Transition, – ."

The sixth final inquiry source called internal criticism. The historical method comprises techniques guidelines historians use primary sources evidence research write history. Herodotus Halicarnassus ( BC – ca. BC)[ ] generally acclaimed "father history". However, contemporary Thucydides (c. BC – c. BC) credited first approached history well-developed historical method work History Peloponnesian War. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history product choices actions human beings, looked cause effect, rather result divine intervention (though Herodotus wholly committed idea himself).[ ] In historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, nominally neutral point view, human world result actions human beings. Greek historians also viewed history cyclical, events regularly recurring.[ ] There historical traditions sophisticated use historical method ancient medieval China. The groundwork professional historiography East Asia established Han dynasty court historian known Sima Qian ( – BC), author Records Grand Historian (Shiji). For quality written work, Sima Qian posthumously known Father Chinese historiography. Chinese historians subsequent dynastic periods China used Shiji official format historical texts, well biographical literature.[citation needed] Saint Augustine influential Christian Western thought beginning medieval period. Through Medieval Renaissance periods, history often studied sacred religious perspective. Around , German philosopher historian Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel brought philosophy secular approach historical study.[ ] In preface book, Muqaddimah ( ), Arab historian early sociologist, Ibn Khaldun, warned seven mistakes thought historians regularly committed. In criticism, approached past strange need interpretation. The originality Ibn Khaldun claim cultural difference another age must govern evaluation relevant historical material, distinguish principles according might possible attempt evaluation, lastly, feel need experience, addition rational principles, order assess culture past. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle superstition uncritical acceptance historical data." As result, introduced scientific method study history, often referred "new science".[ ] His historical method also laid groundwork observation role state, communication, propaganda systematic bias history,[ ] thus considered "father historiography"[ ][ ] "father philosophy history".[ ] In West, historians developed modern methods historiography th th centuries, especially France Germany. In , Herbert Spencer summarized methods: From successive strata historical deposits, [Historians] diligently gather highly colored fragments, pounce upon everything curious sparkling chuckle like children glittering acquisitions; meanwhile rich veins wisdom ramify amidst worthless debris, lie utterly neglected. Cumbrous volumes rubbish greedily accumulated, masses rich ore, dug out, golden truths might smelted, left untaught unsought[ ] By "rich ore" Spencer meant scientific theory history. Meanwhile Henry Thomas Buckle expressed dream history becoming one day science: In regard nature, events apparently irregular capricious explained shown accordance certain fixed universal laws. This done men ability and, all, men patient, untiring thought studied events view discovering regularity, human events subject similar treatment, every right expect similar results[ ] Contrary Buckle's dream, th-century historian greatest influence methods became Leopold von Ranke Germany. He limited history “what really happened” directed field away science. For Ranke, historical data collected carefully, examined objectively put together critical rigor. But procedures “are merely prerequisites preliminaries science. The heart science searching order regularity data examined formulating generalizations laws them.”[ ] As Historians like Ranke many followed pursued it, no, history science. Thus Historians tell us that, given manner practices craft, cannot considered science, must take word. If science, then, whatever else doing, science. The traditional Historian thus scientist history, conventionally practiced, science.[ ] In th century, academic historians focused less epic nationalistic narratives, often tended glorify nation great men, objective complex analyses social intellectual forces. A major trend historical methodology th century tendency treat history social science rather art, traditionally case. Some leading advocates history social science diverse collection scholars included Fernand Braudel, E. H. Carr, Fritz Fischer, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Hans-Ulrich Wehler, Bruce Trigger, Marc Bloch, Karl Dietrich Bracher, Peter Gay, Robert Fogel, Lucien Febvre Lawrence Stone. Many advocates history social science noted multi-disciplinary approach. Braudel combined history geography, Bracher history political science, Fogel history economics, Gay history psychology, Trigger history archaeology Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre Le Roy Ladurie varying differing ways amalgamated history sociology, geography, anthropology, economics. Nevertheless, multidisciplinary approaches failed produce theory history. So far one theory history came pen professional Historian.[ ] Whatever theories history have, written experts fields (for example, Marxian theory history). More recently, field digital history begun address ways using computer technology pose new questions historical data generate digital scholarship. In sincere opposition claims history social science, historians Hugh Trevor-Roper, John Lukacs, Donald Creighton, Gertrude Himmelfarb Gerhard Ritter argued key historians' work power imagination, hence contended history understood art. French historians associated Annales School introduced quantitative history, using raw data track lives typical individuals, prominent establishment cultural history (cf. histoire des mentalités). Intellectual historians Herbert Butterfield, Ernst Nolte George Mosse argued significance ideas history. American historians, motivated civil rights era, focused formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, socio-economic groups. Another genre social history emerge post-WWII era Alltagsgeschichte (History Everyday Life). Scholars Martin Broszat, Ian Kershaw Detlev Peukert sought examine everyday life like ordinary people th-century Germany, especially Nazi period. Marxist historians Eric Hobsbawm, E. P. Thompson, Rodney Hilton, Georges Lefebvre, Eugene Genovese, Isaac Deutscher, C. L. R. James, Timothy Mason, Herbert Aptheker, Arno J. Mayer Christopher Hill sought validate Karl Marx's theories analyzing history Marxist perspective. In response Marxist interpretation history, historians François Furet, Richard Pipes, J. C. D.

Periods Main article: Periodization Historical study often focuses events developments occur particular blocks time. Historians give periods time names order allow "organising ideas classificatory generalisations" used historians.[ ] The names given period vary geographical location, dates beginning end particular period. Centuries decades commonly used periods time represent depends dating system used. Most periods constructed retrospectively reflect value judgments made past. The way periods constructed names given affect way viewed studied.[ ] Prehistoric periodisation The field history generally leaves prehistory archaeologists, entirely different sets tools theories. The usual method periodisation distant prehistoric past, archaeology rely changes material culture technology, Stone Age, Bronze Age Iron Age sub-divisions also based different styles material remains. Here prehistory divided series "chapters" periods history could unfold relative chronology also narrative chronology.[ ] This narrative content could form functional-economic interpretation. There periodisation, however, narrative aspect, relying largely relative chronology and, thus, devoid specific meaning. Despite development recent decades ability radiocarbon dating scientific methods give actual dates many sites artefacts, long-established schemes seem likely remain use. In many cases neighbouring cultures writing left history cultures without it, may used. Periodisation, however, viewed perfect framework one account explaining "cultural changes conveniently start stop (combinedly) periodisation boundaries" different trajectories change also needed studied right get intertwined cultural phenomena.[ ] Geographical locations Particular geographical locations form basis historical study, example, continents, countries, cities. Understanding historic events took place important. To this, historians often turn geography. According Jules Michelet book Histoire de France ( ), "without geographical basis, people, makers history, seem walking air."[ ] Weather patterns, water supply, landscape place affect lives people live there. For example, explain ancient Egyptians developed successful civilization, studying geography Egypt essential. Egyptian civilization built banks Nile River, flooded year, depositing soil banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops feed people cities. That meant everyone farm, people could perform jobs helped develop civilization.

Social history contrasted political history, intellectual history history great men. English historian G. M. Trevelyan saw bridging point economic political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history barren political history unintelligible."[ ] While field often viewed negatively history politics left out, also defended "history people put back in."[ ] Subfields The chief subfields social history include: Demographic history History education Ethnic history History family Labour history Rural history Urban history American urban history Women's history Smaller specialties include: History childhood Gender history Cultural history Main article: Cultural history Cultural history replaced social history dominant form s.

Teaching history Scholarship vs teaching A major intellectual battle took place Britain early twentieth century regarding place history teaching universities. At Oxford Cambridge, scholarship downplayed. Professor Charles Harding Firth, Oxford's Regius Professor history ridiculed system best suited produce superficial journalists. The Oxford tutors, votes professors, fought back defence system saying successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, diplomats, mission valuable training scholars. The tutors dominated debate Second World War. It forced aspiring young scholars teach outlying schools, Manchester University, Thomas Frederick Tout professionalizing History undergraduate programme introducing study original sources requiring writing thesis.[ ][ ] In United States, scholarship concentrated major PhD-producing universities, large number colleges universities focused undergraduate teaching. A tendency st century latter schools increasingly demand scholarly productivity younger tenure-track faculty. Furthermore, universities increasingly relied inexpensive part-time adjuncts classroom teaching.[ ] Nationalism From origins national school systems th century, teaching history promote national sentiment high priority. In United States World War I, strong movement emerged university level teach courses Western Civilization, give students common heritage Europe. In U.S. , attention increasingly moved toward teaching world history requiring students take courses non-western cultures, prepare students life globalized economy.[ ] At university level, historians debate question whether history belongs social science humanities. Many view field perspectives. The teaching history French schools influenced Nouvelle histoire disseminated Cahiers pédagogiques Enseignement journals teachers. Also influential Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, (INRDP). Joseph Leif, Inspector-general teacher training, said pupils children learn historians' approaches well facts dates. Louis François, Dean History/Geography group Inspectorate National Education advised teachers provide historic documents promote "active methods" would give pupils "the immense happiness discovery." Proponents said reaction memorization names dates characterized teaching left students bored. Traditionalists protested loudly postmodern innovation threatened leave youth ignorant French patriotism national identity.[ ] Bias school teaching History books bookstore In several countries history textbooks tools foster nationalism patriotism, give students official line national enemies.[ ] In many countries, history textbooks sponsored national government written put national heritage favourable light. For example, Japan, mention Nanking Massacre removed textbooks entire Second World War given cursory treatment. Other countries complained.[ ] It standard policy communist countries present rigid Marxist historiography.[ ][ ] In United States, history Southern states, slavery American Civil War controversial topics. McGraw-Hill Education example, criticised describing Africans brought American plantations "workers" instead slaves textbook.[ ] Academic historians often fought politicization textbooks, sometimes success.[ ][ ] In st-century Germany, history curriculum controlled states, characterized superpatriotism rather "almost pacifistic deliberately unpatriotic undertone" reflects "principles formulated international organizations UNESCO Council Europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy peace." The result "German textbooks usually downplay national pride ambitions aim develop understanding citizenship centered democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance Europeanness."[ ] See also Main articles: Outline history Glossary history History portal Methods Auxiliary sciences history Archival research Bibliography Computational history List history journals Popular history Topics Historiography Argentina Atlantic history Historiography Canada Classics Greek historiography Historiography Alexander Great Roman historiography Historiography fall Western Roman Empire Historiography Cold War Chinese historiography Historiography French Revolution Annales School, France Historiography Germany Bielefeld School, Germany Historiography early Islam Historiography Japan Middle Ages Dark Ages (historiography) Historiography Crusades Historiography Switzerland Historiography Soviet Union Historiography United States Frontier Thesis Historiography United Kingdom Historiography Scotland Historiography British Empire World history Historiography causes World War I Historiography World War II The history world, common parlance, history humanity (or human history), determined archaeology, anthropology, genetics, linguistics, disciplines; and, periods since invention writing, recorded history secondary sources studies. Humanity's written history preceded prehistory, beginning Palaeolithic Era ("Old Stone Age"), followed Neolithic Era ("New Stone Age"). The Neolithic saw Agricultural Revolution begin, BCE, Near East's Fertile Crescent. During period, humans began systematic husbandry plants animals.[ ] As agriculture advanced, humans transitioned nomadic settled lifestyle farmers permanent settlements. The relative security increased productivity provided farming allowed communities expand increasingly larger units, fostered advances transportation. Whether prehistoric historic times, people always needed near reliable sources potable water. Settlements developed river banks early BCE Mesopotamia,[ ] banks Egypt's Nile River,[ ][ ] Indus River valley,[ ] along China's rivers.[ ][ ] As farming developed, grain agriculture became sophisticated prompted division labour store food growing seasons. Labour divisions led rise leisured upper class development cities, provided foundation civilization. The growing complexity human societies necessitated systems accounting writing. With civilizations flourishing, ancient history ("Antiquity," including Classical Age,[ ] CE[ ]) saw rise fall empires. Post-classical history (the "Middle Ages," c. – CE [ ]) witnessed rise Christianity, Islamic Golden Age (c. CE – c. CE), early Italian Renaissance (from around CE). The mid- th-century invention modern printing, employing movable type,[ ] revolutionized communication facilitated ever wider dissemination information, helping end Middle Ages ushering Scientific Revolution.[ ] The Early Modern Period, sometimes referred "European Age",[ ] ,[ ] included Age Enlightenment Age Discovery. By th century, accumulation knowledge technology reached critical mass brought Industrial Revolution[ ] began Late Modern Period, started around continued present.[ ] This scheme historical periodization (dividing history Antiquity, Post-Classical, Early Modern, Late Modern periods) developed for, applies best to, history Old World, particularly Europe Mediterranean. Outside region, including ancient China ancient India, historical timelines unfolded differently. However, th century, due extensive world trade colonization, histories civilizations become substantially intertwined.

These ancient indigenous societies would greatly affected, good ill, European contact early modern period. Axial Age Main articles: Axial Age, History philosophy, Timeline religion, History religions Buddha Socrates Beginning th century BCE, "Axial Age" saw development set transformative philosophical religious ideas, mostly independently, many different places.[citation needed] Chinese Confucianism, Indian Buddhism Jainism, Jewish monotheism claimed scholars developed th century BCE.

Some areas experienced slow steady technological advances, important developments stirrup moldboard plough arriving every centuries. There were, however, regions, periods rapid technological progress. Most important, perhaps, Hellenistic period region Mediterranean, hundreds technologies invented.[ ] Such periods followed periods technological decay, Roman Empire's decline fall ensuing early medieval period. Declines, falls, resurgence The ancient empires faced common problems associated maintaining huge armies supporting central bureaucracy. These costs fell heavily peasantry, land-owning magnates increasingly evaded centralized control costs. Barbarian pressure frontiers hastened internal dissolution.

European expansion Further information: History Europe, Age Discovery, Colonialism, th century, th century During period, European powers came dominate world. Although developed regions European classical civilization urbanized region world, European civilization undergone lengthy period gradual decline collapse. During Early Modern Period, Europe able regain dominance; historians still debate causes. Europe's success period stands contrast regions. For example, one advanced civilizations Middle Ages China. It developed advanced monetary economy CE. China free peasantry longer subsistence farmers, could sell produce actively participate market. According Adam Smith, writing th century, China long one richest, fertile, best cultivated, industrious, urbanized, prosperous countries world. It enjoyed technological advantage monopoly cast iron production, piston bellows, suspension bridge construction, printing, compass. However, seemed long since stopped progressing. Marco Polo, visited China th century, describes cultivation, industry, populousness almost terms travelers would th century. One theory Europe's rise holds Europe's geography played important role success. The Middle East, India China ringed mountains oceans but, past outer barriers, nearly flat. By contrast, Pyrenees, Alps, Apennines, Carpathians mountain ranges run Europe, continent also divided several seas. This gave Europe degree protection peril Central Asian invaders. Before era firearms, nomads militarily superior agricultural states periphery Eurasian continent and, broke plains northern India valleys China, unstoppable. These invasions often devastating. The Golden Age Islam ended Mongol sack Baghdad . India China subject periodic invasions, Russia spent couple centuries Mongol-Tatar yoke. Central western Europe, logistically distant Central Asian heartland, proved less vulnerable threats. Geography contributed important geopolitical differences. For histories, China, India, Middle East unified single dominant power expanded reached surrounding mountains deserts.[citation needed] In Ottoman Empire controlled almost Middle East,[ ] Ming dynasty ruled China,[ ][ ] Mughal Empire held sway India. By contrast, Europe almost always divided number warring states. Pan-European empires, notable exception Roman Empire, tended collapse soon arose. Another doubtless important geographic factor rise Europe Mediterranean Sea, which, millennia, functioned maritime superhighway fostering exchange goods, people, ideas inventions. Nearly agricultural civilizations heavily constrained environments. Productivity remained low, climatic changes easily instigated boom-and-bust cycles brought civilizations' rise fall. By , however, qualitative change world history. Technological advance wealth generated trade gradually brought widening possibilities.[ ] world map, showing Europeans' discoveries Many also argued Europe's institutions allowed expand, property rights free-market economics stronger elsewhere due ideal freedom peculiar Europe. In recent years, however, scholars Kenneth Pomeranz challenged view. Europe's maritime expansion unsurprisingly—given continent's geography—was largely work Atlantic states: Portugal, Spain, England, France, Netherlands. Initially Portuguese Spanish Empires predominant conquerors sources influence, union resulted Iberian Union, first global empire "sun never set". Soon northern English, French Dutch began dominate Atlantic. In series wars fought th th centuries, culminating Napoleonic Wars, Britain emerged new world power. Regional developments Hagia Sophia, Istanbul (formerly Constantinople), Turkey Persia came rule Safavid Empire , succeeded Afsharid Empire , Zand Empire , Qajar Empire .

Taj Mahal, Mughal Empire, India On Indian subcontinent, Delhi Sultanate Deccan sultanates would give way, beginning th century, Mughal Empire.[citation needed] Starting northwest, Mughal Empire would late th century come rule entire subcontinent,[ ] except southernmost Indian provinces, would remain independent. Against Muslim Mughal Empire, Hindu Maratha Empire founded west coast , gradually gaining territory—a majority present-day India—from Mughals several decades, particularly Mughal–Maratha Wars ( – ). The Maratha Empire would fall control British East India Company, former Maratha Mughal authority devolving British Raj. In Portuguese overthrew Malacca Sultanate present-day Malaysia Indonesian Sumatra. The Portuguese held important trading territory (and valuable associated navigational strait) overthrown Dutch . The Johor Sultanate, centred southern tip Malay Peninsula, became dominant trading power region. European colonization expanded Dutch Netherlands East Indies, Portuguese East Timor, Spanish Philippines. Into th century, European expansion would affect whole Southeast Asia, British Myanmar Malaysia French Indochina. Only Thailand would successfully resist colonization. The Pacific islands Oceania would also affected European contact, starting circumnavigational voyage Ferdinand Magellan, landed Marianas islands . Also notable voyages ( – ) Abel Tasman present-day Australia, New Zealand nearby islands, voyages ( – ) Captain James Cook, made first recorded European contact Hawaii. Britain would found first colony Australia . In Americas, western European powers vigorously colonized newly discovered continents, largely displacing indigenous populations, destroying advanced civilizations Aztecs Incas. Spain, Portugal, Britain, France made extensive territorial claims, undertook large-scale settlement, including importation large numbers African slaves. Portugal claimed Brazil. Spain claimed rest South America, Mesoamerica, southern North America. Britain colonized east coast North America, France colonized central region North America. Russia made incursions onto northwest coast North America, first colony present-day Alaska , outpost Fort Ross present-day California .[ ] In , midst Seven Years' War, France secretly ceded North American claims Spain Treaty Fontainebleau.

The British also colonized Australia, New Zealand South Africa large numbers British colonists emigrating colonies. Russia colonized large pre-agricultural areas Siberia. In late th century, European powers divided remaining areas Africa. Within Europe, economic military challenges created system nation states, ethno-linguistic groupings began identify distinctive nations aspirations cultural political autonomy.
