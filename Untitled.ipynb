find the other physics makes particular use of calculus all concepts in classical mechanics and electromagnetism are related through calculus the mass of an object of known density the moment of inertia of objects as well as the total energy of an object within a conservative field can be found by the use of calculus an example of the use of calculus in mechanics is newton s second law of motion historically stated it expressly uses the term change of motion which implies the derivative saying the change of momentum of a body is equal to the resultant force acting on the body and is in the same direction commonly expressed today as force mass acceleration it implies differential calculus because acceleration is the time derivative of velocity or second time derivative of trajectory or spatial position starting from knowing how an object is accelerating we use calculus to derive its path maxwell s theory of electromagnetism and einstein s theory of general relativity are also expressed in the language of differential calculus chemistry also uses calculus in determining reaction rates and radioactive decay in biology population dynamics starts with reproduction and death rates to model population changes calculus can be used in conjunction with other mathematical disciplines for example it can be used with linear algebra to find the best fit linear approximation for a set of points in a domain or it can be used in probability theory to determine the probability of a continuous random variable from an assumed density function in analytic geometry the study of graphs of functions calculus is used to find high points and low points maxima and minima slope concavity and inflection points green s theorem which gives the relationship between a line integral around a

for example it can be used to calculate the amount of area taken up by an irregularly shaped flower bed or swimming pool when designing the layout of a piece of property discrete green s theorem which gives the relationship between a double integral of a function around a simple closed rectangular curve c and a linear combination of the antiderivative s values at corner points along the edge of the curve allows fast calculation of sums of values in rectangular domains for example it can be used to efficiently calculate sums of rectangular domains in images in order to rapidly extract features
